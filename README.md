# Spam-Email-and-Url-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Detection of spam emails and spam urls by classification with machine learning

## Getting Started

The data sets used in the project were taken from the addresses below

- Spam Email Data Set ➡️ https://www.kaggle.com/mfaisalqureshi/spam-email?select=spam.csv
- Spam Url Data Set ➡️ https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/spam-url-prediction

Thank you to the friends who provided these datasets.

## Dataset 

* This dataset (spam.csv) contains a total of ```5572 data```.  There are ```%83 safe and %17 spam```.
* This dataset (url_spam_classification.csv) contains a total of ```148.303 data```.  There are ```%68 safe and %32 spam```.


## Classification

Classification algorithms used for spam email detection :
```
* Decision Tree
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine
```

Classification algorithms used for spam url detection :
```
* Decision Tree
* Stochastic Gradient Descent
* Multinomial Naive Bayes
* Linear Support Vector
```
